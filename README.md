overly-excited exercise 
i created a function that allows two arguments, then i looped over the element arrays Added logic to addExcitement that places an exclamation point (!) after every third word.
also added a new argument to the function so that a developer can specify which character should be displayed instead of it always being an exclamation point.# overly-excited2
